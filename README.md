## Development

A guide to getting started with Primero development is available [here](doc/getting_started_development.md).

## Notes

- It is known that a few npm packages will throw a `requires a peer of` warning. Examples: Mui-datatables is behind on updating dependecies. Jsdom requires canvas, but we are mocking canvas. Canvas also requires extra packages on alpine, which is the reason for mocking canvas.
